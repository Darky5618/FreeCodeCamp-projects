        <p>
          <strong>Jiraiya</strong> is a Shinobi from the village of
          <strong>Konoha</strong>gakure trained by
          <strong>Hiruzen Sarutobi</strong>, the Third Hokage, with his
          teammates <strong>Tsunade</strong> and <strong>Orochimaru</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He became known as the "<strong>Toad Sage</strong>" due to his
          training under the Great Toad Sage in the field of Senjutsu (仙術,
          lit. "sage techniques") at <strong>Mount Myōboku</strong>, enabling
          him to summon toads as allies during battles. The Great Toad Sage also
          informs Jiraiya of a prophecy that he will mentor a child who will
          either save the world or destroy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although their team under Hiruzen's leadership had disbanded,
          Jiraiya,Orochimaru, and Tsunade continued fighting together during
          the<strong>Second Shinobi World War</strong>. During one such fight in
          Amegakure, they were the only three to survive an encounter with
          <strong>Hanzō</strong>, for which accomplishment Hanzō dubbed them
          Konoha's "<strong>Legendary Sannin</strong>".
        </p>
        <p>
          After the battle, three war orphans approached them and asked to be
          taught <strong>ninjutsu</strong>. Jiraiya, guilty for his involvement
          in the war, decided to stay in Ame for a time in order to look after
          them. Shortly after he joined them, he discovered that one of the
          orphans, <strong>Nagato</strong>, possessed the
          <strong>Rinnegan</strong>, once used by the
          <strong>Sage of the Six Paths</strong> to save the world. Jiraiya
          decided that Nagato was the <strong>Child of the Prophecy</strong>,
          and as such agreed to teach the orphans ninjutsu so that he might
          guide Nagato towards the world's salvation.
